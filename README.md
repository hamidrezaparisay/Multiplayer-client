This is a example project that implement a physics based multi player game with client-side predection and server corrections.
You can find the server project here https://github.com/hamidrezaparisay/Multiplayer-server.

as you can see server and client are sync. the jittery movement of client can be fixed by interpolating when a correction happens.
